This directory contains a number of utility functions in python.

* Mod-Demod-Python - contains a set of functions which are compatible with Octave/MATLAB for psk and qam modulation.
(In COMS4105) these are required for the practicals)
* SpectrumPlot-Python - this example shows how to use the welch function in Python. It shows a single sided and two sided spectrum.
(It basically depends on if the input is real or complex)
* loadutil.py / python-Data-loading.ipynb - this file contains some functions which let you load files recorded using `rtl_sdr`
* bitutil.py - this file contains functions to mimic MATLAB's int2bit, bit2int
